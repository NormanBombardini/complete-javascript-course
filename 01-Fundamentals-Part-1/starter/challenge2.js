/* Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Printaniceoutputtotheconsole,sayingwhohasthehigherBMI.Themessage is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. UseatemplateliteraltoincludetheBMIvaluesintheoutputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */
